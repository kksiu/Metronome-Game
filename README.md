Metronome-Game
==============

This is really just a test of a simple iOS project

The game is to try and replicate metronome beats based on button pressing. One can hear the beat if need to by pushing the switch on the button.

At the end of the 5 seconds, the game will tell you how close your average button pressing was to the current beats per minute shown on the slider.
